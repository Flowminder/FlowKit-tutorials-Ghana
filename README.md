# FlowKit tutorials

Here are some tutorials that will teach you how to use FlowKit for CDR analysis.

## What is FlowKit?

- and why do I care?  

## What is FlowClient?

- Python client for communicating with a FlowKit server  
- Will use FlowClient in these tutorials  

## Contents

### Basic

In this section you will learn how to connect to a FlowKit server and get aggregated data.

- [Getting started with FlowClient](01-getting-started-with-flowclient.ipynb)  
- [Running a query](02-running-a-query.ipynb)  

### Intermediate

In this section you will learn more about the kinds of queries that are available in FlowKit.

- [Geography](03-geography.ipynb)  
- [More complex queries](04-more-complex-queries.ipynb)  

### Advanced

In this section you will learn some alternative ways to use FlowClient, which may be more convenient in some situations.
You can use FlowClient without knowing this stuff...

- [Async client](05-async-client.ipynb)  
- [Lower-level functions](06-lower-level-functions.ipynb)  

## Next steps

Once you have worked through these tutorials, have a look at the [worked examples](https://flowkit.xyz/analyst/worked_examples/) to see some practical examples of analysis using FlowKit.
(Note: would be good to also add a how-to / worked example here for the COVID aggregates / indicators)
