# FlowKit tutorials

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Flowminder/FlowKit-tutorials-Ghana/new_content?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb)

This is a Binder repository of tutorials for learning how to use [FlowKit](https://flowkit.xyz/) for CDR analysis. The tutorials are Jupyter notebooks which use the [FlowClient](https://flowkit.xyz/analyst/#flowclient) python client to interact with FlowKit. These tutorials are designed to be used with the Ghana FlowCloud deployment at [api.flowcloud-ghana.flowminder.org](https://api.flowcloud-ghana.flowminder.org/api/0/spec/redoc).

To run the tutorials, click the Binder badge above.

(TODO: add some instructions for running locally, as an alternative to Binder)
