    "# Running a query\n",
    "In the previous tutorial ([Getting started with FlowClient](01-getting-started-with-flowclient.ipynb)), you learned how to use the FlowClient library to connect to a FlowKit server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to use FlowClient to run a FlowKit query and get the result as a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a query?\n",
    "\n",
    "A FlowKit query is a set of parameters that specify a result that can be calculated from the CDR data within the FlowKit database. FlowClient enables you to specify a query, and ask the FlowKit server to run the query and return the result. Some examples of the kinds of queries that FlowKit supports are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `unique_subscriber_counts`: Count the number of unique susbcribers who were active in a location during a specified time period,  \n",
    "- `location_event_counts`: Count the number of CDR events (calls, SMS, ...) in a location during a specified time period,  \n",
    "- `total_network_objects`: Count the number of network objects (cells) in a location during a specified time period.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A full list of available query kinds can be found on the [FlowKit documentation website](https://flowkit.xyz/flowclient/flowclient/aggregates/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some restrictions on the query results you are allowed to get from FlowKit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot get results which provide information about individual subscribers - FlowKit will only provide results which are aggregated to groups of subscribers (for example, number of subscribers in a region).  \n",
    "- Only aggregates of more than 15 subscribers are included in the results (for example, if one region only contains 15 subscribers, the subscriber count for that region will not be included in the output from FlowKit).  \n",
    "- You can only get the result of a query if your access token allows it. An access token can control access to query kinds (for example, you may be allowed to get the result of a `location_event_counts` query but not a `total_network_objects` query), and also query parameters (for example, you may be allowed to get the unique subscriber counts per region (admin1), but not per district (admin2)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Run a query\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start this tutorial by getting the result of a `unique_subscriber_counts` query as a pandas DataFrame.\n",

In this case we want to count subscribers on just one day, so we set `end_date = \"2016-01-02\"` (the day after `start_date`).\n",

In this case, we want the locations to be districts, so we set `aggregation_unit = \"admin2\"`.

The `location_event_counts` and `total_network_objects` query kinds each have an additional parameter (`location_event_counts` queries have a `count_interval` parameter, and `total_network_objects` queries have a `total_by` parameter). In both cases, these parameters specify the time intervals over which results should be aggregated.
