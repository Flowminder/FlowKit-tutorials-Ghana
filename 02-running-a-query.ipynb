    "# Running a query\n",
    "In the previous tutorial ([Getting started with FlowClient](01-getting-started-with-flowclient.ipynb)), you learned how to use the FlowClient library to connect to a FlowKit server.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What is a query?  \n",
    "- Limitations: only aggregates, only redacted, only what's allowed by token (which is more granular than just query kind)  \n",
    "    - Create connection (and link to previous tutorial for more details)\n",
    "    - Create (simple) query object (and explain what this is - not the result, and not yet communicated with server in any way). Explain parameters, but point to geography tutorial for more details of aggregation unit parameter\n",
    "    - Get result. Explain what this does - i.e. sends query to server to run, and waits until it can get the result, then gets it\n",
    "    - Explain progress bar (with details about FlowKit splitting query into sub-queries, and why (caching and re-use). For this simple query, probably only one component, but will see more complex ones later)\n",
    "    - Show result is a dataframe\n",
    "    - Long-running queries: run and status\n",
    "        - Some queries can take a long time - don't want to have to wait for them to finish before doing something else\n",
    "        - Can use run / check status / get result workflow\n",
    "        - Create new query\n",
    "        - status: not running\n",
    "        - run\n",
    "        - status: queued or executing\n",
    "        - Create and run another query\n",
    "        - Check status of both\n",
    "        - Once it's finished, status is \"finished\"\n",
    "        - At any time, can use get_result to wait and get result. If it's already finished, will return result immediately\n",
    "        - This way, can run many queries at once, rather than waiting for one to finish before starting the next\n",
    "    - Any other query object methods/attributes (if there are any - I'll cover result format in the geography tutorial)"
