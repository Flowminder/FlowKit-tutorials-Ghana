# Using FlowAuth

Instructions for how to do things in FlowAuth...

I haven't decided exactly where this file should live - it's not a FlowClient tutorial, but is required knowledge for using FlowKit

## Creating a token

(Step-by-step including screenshots)

- Steps to create and view/copy/download a token  
- Customising a token, and why you might want to  

See [Getting started with FlowClient](getting-started-with-flowclient.ipynb) to learn how to use this token in a FlowKit connnection.

## Other...

- e.g. changing password, enabling 2fa, etc.  
- Maybe put these in separate pages  
- Probably not necessary for now
